abstract: "Analyzing high-dimensional with manifold learning algorithms often requires searching for the nearest neighbors of all observations. This presents a computational bottleneck when data size is large or when observations lie in more general metric spaces, such as statistical manifolds. We resolve this problem by proposing a broad range of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods to be used within manifold learning. The novelty of our evaluation of ANN algorithms is the manifold learning setting, with algorithms compared on the basis of embedding accuracy. A second novel contribution is to use ANN for statistical manifolds by exploiting the connection between Hellinger/Total variation distance for discrete distributions and the L2/L1 norm. A thorough empirical investigation of the benchmark MNIST dataset shows that ANN algorithms substantially improve computational time with little to no loss in the accuracy of manifold learning embedding. The result is robust to different manifold learning algorithms, different approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, and different measures of embedding accuracy. The proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds of electricity usage. This application demonstrates how underlying structures in high dimensional data, including anomalies, can be visualized and identified, in a way that is scalable to large datasets."
